    text:`In the second episode, the protagonist Kaiya finds himself awakening in a watery abyss, which is revealed to be a black market bustling with repurposed electronic devices. A clinic seemingly operates from this covert location, attracting Kaiya's curious gaze.

    As Kaiya ventures further, he encounters a woman with a young boy. Their wary glance prompts him to retreat and retrace his steps. For the first time, he views the market from an outside perspective. The cleanliness of the market's exterior and its green floors sharply contrast the underlying lawlessness.
    
    Just as Kaiya steps out, the sound of distant sirens forces him into narrow back alleys. On his way, he encounters a distressing scene of a fire breakout. Suspecting an arsonist, Kaiya uncovers an unsettling noise amidst the chaos. The intermittent sound, strikingly similar to a baby's cry or a cat's mew, urges him into action.
    
    Defying local regulations, Kaiya uses his hoverboard to rise above the pandemonium. As the fire spreads, he races against time to douse the flames. Amidst the danger, he discovers an abandoned baby and a robot. Faced with a moral dilemma, Kaiya chooses to rescue the infant, while the robot helps quench the fire.`,

The two quickly form a friendship, and Kaiya finds himself invited to a gathering. However, he senses a peculiar atmosphere at the event.

    Just as he decides to leave and gets ready to ride his hoverboard, another young man approaches him. The newcomer addresses Kaiya as the subject of recent city rumors. It appears that word of Kaiya's heroic act of saving a baby from a fire has spread, and this young man claims to be an eyewitness of the incident. Before parting, the young man insists on giving Kaiya his contact information, which adds another layer of intrigue to Kaiya's already complicated life in the city.

    Uncomfortable with the situation, Kaiya grumbles, "Give me a break, this will make me sick." But the woman presses on, claiming that it's a waste not to respond when one is wanted so badly. He shrugs and allows her to lean on him, her weighty chest pressing against his flat one. Her body, cool and eerily android-like due to its lower body temperature, brings an unsettling feeling. The perfectly blended scent of her perfume fills his nostrils, causing him to grimace involuntarily.
